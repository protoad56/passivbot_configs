would be nice to see what caused the results above
Doftorul â€” 12/21/2022 12:30 AM
wicks is my guess ðŸ™‚
but then it might be a bug too
hzlt â€” 12/21/2022 12:31 AM
yeah, hard to tell for me atm
could be an aggregation issue maybe, but im on 1s
like below
Image
Doftorul â€” 12/21/2022 12:32 AM
yeah
we'll get to the bottom of it
step by step
once we are able to see it in greater detail it will be easier to also spot weird behavior
the cherry on top will be when i can pull data in real time as the backtest happens
@Hawkeye has some ideas and will code the hooks so i can use them in the visualizer
at least one can break the backtest early if the shit hits the fan and saves some time
but the first version is static

@Neoraptor your DYDX configuration should have hit a GTFO during this night I think, now time to analyse how this could have been avoided
Neoraptor â€” 12/21/2022 8:44 AM
Hey, it indeed the GTFO order once ðŸ˜‰
It is good to have this one checked as well.
I'll experiment a bit with the new settings to only enter when near bigger supports/resistances and see if this help 
hzlt â€” 12/21/2022 2:29 PM
not too good unfortunately, but at least you don't have serious draw downs this way

open the txt in notepad++ or vscode, notepad ruins the layout idk why
and i was told there's a bug in sl with high volatility, so might not be too accurate since there's plenty high vol areas in the from-to date
trying with gtfo as well now
Hawkeye â€” 12/21/2022 2:36 PM
the SL will be fairly accurate in BT, in live the price might suddenly shoot past it; in that case HB should place the SL just beyond the current price and keep trying / push the SL price closer to where it should be; atm it won't do that
Hawkeye â€” 12/22/2022 9:57 PM
@Neoraptor @JordanM maybe good to share & discuss your backtest attempts mod publicly here, since youâ€™re both checking on some ideas. Might also be useful to share your reasoning on what your trying, perhaps it sparks some thoughts with other people too ðŸ™‚
Neoraptor â€” 12/22/2022 10:18 PM
I have been playing around the new parameters, to avoid entering near support/resistances. Here is the result of a few attempts:
Same configs (2 DCA 15min / 1% GTFO / 0.25% TP), only changing the no_entry_within_resistance_distance:
* no filtering near resistance: +34$ / 569 entries / 15 gtfo
* 0.5%: +41$ / 554 entries / 14 gtfo
* 1%: +42$ / 523 entries / 13 gtfo
* 1.5%: +24$ / 404 entries / 13 gtfo
* 2%: +14$ / 405 entries / 11 gtfo
* 2.5%: +47$ / 356 entries / 7 gtfo
* 3%: 17.4$ / 413 entries / 11 gtfo
* 3.5%: 8$ / 391 entries / 11 gtfo
* 4%: 3$ / 348 entries / 10 gtfo
* 5%: + 33$ / 343 entries / 7 gtfo

The idea behind is to find a config that is capable of taking loss from time to time while having a good win ratio.
Here the base config (same all the time)
{
  # python3.11 backtest.py -b 500 -d 20221201-20221220 --config user_data/configTest3.json -t 1s

Hawkeye â€” 03/20/2024 3:13 PM
@vsn is actively working with the HFT-configs, I've asked him to share a config every now & then when he makes updates; ofc in the end it's everybody's own responsibility what they're trading ðŸ™‚
also, be aware there's a clear dinstiction between the HFT and the core which is HB really ðŸ™‚
vsn â€” 03/20/2024 3:18 PM
right now market has no volume unfortunately, but with FOMC in a few hours we should have some movement, will update on which config "should" be ran, I'm not responsible for any losses incurred ðŸ˜‚
Hawkeye â€” 03/20/2024 8:41 PM
one can use this as a starting point for a relative easier setup; it's not the HFT, but rather working on support/resistance levels. Surely people will have questions on the parameters, so fire away when you've got questions ðŸ™‚

Hawkeye â€” 03/22/2024 5:50 AM
Results like above basically require a high leverage and high ratio power
Anything below 1.4 will be too far from PA, you really to catch them wicks
Iâ€™m thinking if itâ€™ll help everyone understand the whole thing a bit better if I do a webinar about it for an hour or so, what do les everyone think?
Thereâ€™s a lot of things in the bot, and it can very quite overwhelming at first, but once you dive into it it really makes sense on what it does
The strategies are open source, so everybody can read what it does basically

The outer price governs the width of the grid; in the example itâ€™s set to a fixed grid width, but you can shady configure it to be automatically reach up to a support/resistance level within a certain range

So this one is an example of how you could do long and short where the long exposure is higher and your probably going to hit liquidation before SL on the long side, but with the short side using a lower exposure you'll be stopped out to preserve capital. (this is risky, beware)

I expect you canâ€™t run this with a rice money wallet of $50, seeing the width of the grid, nr of clusters & high ratio powerâ€¦

Yeah. But it doesnt place the full Grid.
vsn â€” 04/02/2024 3:39 PM
I strongly advise against SL for the tight configs, altho 4.9% is pretty wide even with 5 orders, not gonna talk about shorting aswell... risking capital for very little gain while it can be used for the long side to print more, or simply have enough margin to dca.. the short side will liq sooner than later I'm afraid 
Hawkeye â€” 04/02/2024 3:42 PM
agree that shorting can be much more dangerous, I run it only for the sake of science ðŸ™‚
vsn â€” 04/02/2024 3:44 PM
4.9% too tight for shorting imo, should at least be a good 7%, green candles pop way too much and the retrace is very small compared to the opposite
flyingtoaster â€” 04/02/2024 6:18 PM
Oh I was reading this forgetting I had changed the params a bit, so long exposure 6 short exposure 2, total 8 with a tight stop on the short side typically with a high RP you do not fall out of range often with 5 levels and that grid span but obviously is going to vary and cannot be perfect really
So if you do it that way, with those exposures; your short pos actually wont get liq'd; it gets stopped before liq
But with those params above that I had posted indeed you would not reach short stop loss I believe pretty much based on exposures
Short liq would hit first
vsn â€” 04/02/2024 6:38 PM
stops are your worst enemy
wiser to just have enough margin to do a couple heavy dcas on the next levels and let it retrace, the odds of that happening are extremely high and you'll exponentially increase your gains, sure there's gonna be a lot more risk involved but worth it, stops will just endlessly bleed your wallet on the tight grids
